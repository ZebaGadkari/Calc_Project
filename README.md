Simple Calculator
This GitHub repository showcases a simple calculator application built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The repository contains three main files: index.html, script.js, and style.css.

    index.html: This is the main HTML file that provides the structure of the calculator interface. It includes buttons for digits, operators, and functions to perform basic arithmetic operations.

    script.js: The JavaScript file script.js contains the logic that enables the calculator to function. It handles user input, performs calculations, and updates the display accordingly.

    style.css: The style.css file is responsible for the visual styling of the calculator interface. It defines the layout, colors, and overall appearance of the calculator.
